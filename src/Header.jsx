    <h2>About me</h2>  
      <p>After 20 successful years as a professional writer, including roles at Lancashire Business View and freelance work for prestigious publications like The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, I am transitioning into a career in software development.</p>
      <p>Throughout my writing career, I honed transferable skills such as problem-solving, project management, and delivering high-quality work under tight deadlines. I thrived in collaborative environments, juggling multiple responsibilities, and meeting client needs with creativity and precision.</p>
      <p>To pursue my passion for technology, I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience in Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. I’ve built projects ranging from responsive web applications to task management tools, showcasing my ability to adapt and excel in a new industry.</p>
      <p>I’m excited to bring my unique blend of creativity, analytical thinking, and technical skills to the development world. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact, while continuing to learn and grow as a developer. </p>
